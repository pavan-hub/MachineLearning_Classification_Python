Project_1:
It is a binary classifier,that is trained on the dataset to build a decision tree model.
The data is about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness.
During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.
The algorithm aims to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.

Project_2:
It is a classification problem. 
That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, a model is built to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.

Project_3:
The data is of a telecommunications company that is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. 
The model is built to analyse the customersof this company and to find out who is leaving and why.

Project_4:
This Project uses SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using human cell records, 
and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
